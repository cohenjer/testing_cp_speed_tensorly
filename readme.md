A small repo to share tests on CP in tensorly, regarding speed.

I supposed that the repository where venvs are stored is ~/.venvs/, if this is not the case you should modify the script.sh file.

Else to run, make script.sh runnable, then
./script.sh PATH_TO_DEV_TENSORLY

since most recent tensorly version is non pip installable, the user must provide the path to his local tensorly repo.
